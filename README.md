> _GitHub action for setting up the Protocol Buffers compiler_

**setup-protoc** is a revised and updated version of [Arduino/setup-protoc](https://github.com/Arduino/setup-protoc) to fix detecting ARM64 and other reasons.

To use the action, you can just replace `Arduino/setup-protoc` with `Noelware/setup-protoc` and it will work the same as before, but with much better detection.
